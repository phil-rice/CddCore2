__Possibly wrong behaviour__
If there are two scenarios that come to the same conclusion and have different bys, at the moment one of the bys is ignored... Not entirely sure how to deal with this...


__Needs to work better__
The utilities Reflection class uses Java reflection. Thus it doesn't actually pick up things in traits in it's FieldMaps. It is desirable for that to be done
The JUnit tests aren't picked up by SBT, although they are by IntelliJ. This will probably require a 'TestFramework' to be written


__Untested areas of code__
The decision tree 'path' code (which is used for the rendering) isn't tested
