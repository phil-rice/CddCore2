3.0.1 Added LICENSE file, and a copyright notice to all scala files
3.0.2 The expected for scenarios is now visible in the html produced by the Junit run
3.0.3 Much improved rendering of html in the reports. Much improved error reporting, including advice. The tests can now be run from SBT using a TestFramework.

Known issues
Need to complete the 'allow merge'
   1: The errors that have a 'reason' need to use the correct scenario in the Conclusion node, not just the main scenario
   2: The rendering of decision tree doesn't show merged nodes
   3: Need some good tests around html rendering
